Hello! My name is Dawei Li (李大为). I am a graduate student in the [Department of Astronomy][DoA] at [Xiamen University][XMU] in China and surpervised by [Prof. Taotao Fang][Taotao]. Before coming to Xiamen University, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from [Tianjin University of Technology and Education][TUTE].

Currently I'm mainly focusing on the diffuse X-ray emission in galaxies and galaxy groups, especially in poor galaxy groups. Also, I am interested in various research topics, like cosmology, exoplanets, and more. If you are interested in any of my projects, please feel free to [contact][contact] me!
